A simple plugin that provides arcade wars with your Towny plugin. The author of the plugin is karlov_m. TownyWars is a fairly new plugin, but it is already able to provide simple, and most importantly interesting wars between cities.

___

## 
## How it works
There are neutral cities and non-neutral ones. Only non-neutral cities can declare war. After the Declaration of war, both cities have points that are calculated from the number of citizens. When a citizen from one city is killed by a citizen from another, one point is taken away from the city of the victim and transferred to the attacking city. During the war, both cities cannot turn on the Pvp.
